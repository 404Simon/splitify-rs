# RSA timing sidechannel vulnerability in sqlx-mysql
# We only use SQLite and never MySQL, so this is not exploitable in our application
# Issue tracked: https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/issues/RUSTSEC-2023-0071
# We've set default-features = false on sqlx but the macro still pulls in mysql support
#
# paste crate - unmaintained but required by Leptos framework
# Monitoring for Leptos to migrate away from it
